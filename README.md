In Planetary Pillager fight two teams against each other for resources in space. There are asteroids spawning around the map which have the precious Chromatium in them. Jump with your Jetpack and your Bridge Building tool from asteroid to asteroid and mine them with your Mining Laser. Deliver 64 Chromatium back to your base to win the game!

This map includes:
-five different randomly generated asteroids
-a custom Resource pack with models for the tools and textures for the asteroids
-a small Ingame-Tutorial
-play with as many people as you like (might lag with too many players though)
-Settings

Please note that the map will lag for a moment at the beginning and ending of a session.
